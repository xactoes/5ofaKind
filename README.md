# 5 of a Kind

This is a gameboy clone of the game of yahtzee. It is not finished. It does play though but be aware there are missing features listed below the rest of this text.

Just grab the .gb file from releases if you wish to play this on a gameboy emulator.

Game has been tested on some hardware (GBC, GBA, GBASP). Works as well as it does in an emulator it seems. If you wish to test it on actual hardware, please feel free but I'm not responsible for damage done to the hardware (although I'd be surprised and incredibly curious how it the damage came to be).

That said, if you do test it, feel free to contact me about bugs and I'll try to fix them.
